                <h1>Interesting</h1>
                    <p>I studied Web development a little in school, where we made simple html pages in a notebook, with different animations and so on, it seemed fun to me then, but no more.
                    Already at the end of my studies at the university, I decided to link my life with IT, but I started studying web design, how many commercial offers did I make. 
                    When I meet with my friends who work as developers, I saw how their eyes were burning when they speak about work, they really like what they do and I decided for myself that I also want to!
                    Friends was advised to me where to start and for more than a year I have been studying new, interesting, exciting things.</p>
